# ðŸŒŸ Exciting News! ðŸŒŸ

## INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS (ICACIA - 2024)

I am honored to have received the **"Best Paper Award"** and the **"Conference Presenter Award"** at the **ICACIA International Conference** held at IITM on June 21-22, 2024! ðŸŽ‰

### Name of the Model: "ResQBot"

**Title:** An Innovative Rescue Resource Management Model For Cloud Based IOT Environment

---

This recognition means a lot to me, and I couldn't have achieved this milestone without the incredible guidance and mentorship of **Dr. Manzoor Sir**. His expertise and support were invaluable in shaping my research paper on my developed IoT model project, **"ResQBot Ver.2"**, the updated version of **"CyberRover Ver.1"**.

We were discussing the development of innovative solutions using this algorithm and obtaining funding from Government MSME. My research paper and presentation were judged by **Dr. Veerendra Yadav (Chair)**.

**"ResQBot Ver.2"** is an innovative rescue solution that builds on the foundation of **"CyberRover Ver.1"**. Our focus is on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in rescue operations, and this recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone involved. We are now working to develop innovative solutions in upcoming fields.

One key lesson I learned from my mentor is: **"Success is built on the lessons learned from failure. Every setback is a step forward in disguise."**

Thank you to the ICACIA committee for this incredible honor and to everyone who supported me on this journey. I'm excited to continue innovating and making impactful contributions to the field of IoT and rescue solutions. ðŸš€
